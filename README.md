Mobile application designed to allow users to network with one another and to find and start local events, get togethers, socials, etc. 
Application will consist of a backend section where users will create an account(that will in theory) be validated for safety reasons and stored in a database. 
App features will consist of a local area map(probably powered by a third-party mapping API such as Google Maps API) users will then be able to either select specific locations(such as businesses and known activities) 
and start an event there, add a description. Other users will then be able to select these points on the map and express their interest in attending.  
Along with that, there would also be a chat box allowing people to talk, share socials, etc.
